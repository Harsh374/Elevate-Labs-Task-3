🏠 Housing Price Prediction — Linear Regression Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression using Python's popular libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

The dataset used (Housing.csv) contains various features related to houses, such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, and more.

📋 Project Structure
Simple Linear Regression:

Predict house prices based only on area.

Multiple Linear Regression:

Predict house prices based on multiple features (area, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.).

Both models are evaluated using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared (R² Score)

🚀 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Harsh374/Elevate-Labs-Task-3
   cd your-repo-name
2. Install dependencies (optional virtual environment recommended):
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
3. Run the code:
   Open and execute the Jupyter Notebook / Python script.

📈 Results
Simple Linear Regression:

MAE: ~ ₹1.47 Million

R² Score: ~ 27%

Multiple Linear Regression:

MAE: ~ ₹0.97 Million

R² Score: ~ 65%

Adding more features significantly improved model performance!

🧠 Key Learnings
Preprocessing data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).

Understanding model assumptions (linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, no multicollinearity).

Evaluating regression models using MAE, MSE, and R².

Visualizing model performance with plots (actual vs predicted).
